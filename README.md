# Damjengi
is a graphical college application strategist.

You input estimates of your admissions chances at each school and 
the amount of utility you associate with going there, 
and Damjengi sorts the schools in the order you should apply
to them in order to maximize your expected payoff.

The underlying algorithm is described in my [MS thesis](https://github.com/maxkapur/CollegeApplication).
